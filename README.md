# Description
## Problem
Traditional in-person ordering limits customer convenience and reduces potential sales.  
**Problem:** Our restaurant wants to get more customers by allowing them to order online.  
**Solution:** Create a web app that allows customers to browse the menu, customize items, and place orders directly from their devices.

## 📌 Features (Based on User Stories)

### Browse Menu Items
- Users can view all available menu items.
- Each item shows its **name, description, and price**.
- If no items are available, a message appears: *“No items available.”*

### Add Items to Cart
- Clicking an item adds it to the cart.
- Cart total updates immediately after any change.
- If an item is out of stock, users see an error message.
- Once checkout is complete, the order becomes **final and uneditable**.

### Search Functionality
- A search bar appears when the menu page loads.
- Users can search for items by name or description.
- If no results match, the system shows: *“No matching items found.”*

### Edit Items in Cart
- Users can modify items in their cart (quantity, toppings, size, etc.) before checkout.
- Edits update the cart summary and total immediately.
- Order details clearly display item name, description, quantity, and price.
