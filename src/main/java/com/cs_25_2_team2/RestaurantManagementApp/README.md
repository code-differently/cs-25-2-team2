## Description of App
A potato-themed food ordering simulator inspired by Brooklynâ€™s desire for potatoes and our love for food delivery. Users can browse a menu of potato dishes, add items to their cart, and place an order that flows through cooking and delivery stages. The project demonstrates object-oriented design and SOLID principles with custom data structures, meaningful object relationships, and an end-to-end order lifecycle.
